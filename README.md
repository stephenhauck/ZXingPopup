# ZXingPopup
Xamarin Shell Zxing with  community toolkit popups

This is simply to show how to use the Xamarin Community Toolkit popups with ZXing in an app for barcode scanning 
This can be improved using DI and some other techniques and there is a little code in the code behind to make life simpler.
I have NOT tested this on iOS but should be fine .... 

Contact me if you have any questions or are in need of my development or analytical skills and experience.

Enjoy!
